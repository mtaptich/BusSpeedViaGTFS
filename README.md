===============

<b> Estimating Bus Speed using d3.js and GTFS </b>
<p> In this example, I used data on bus routes, bus arrival times, stop locations, ect. that are provided by the <a href="http://sfmta.com/about-sfmta/reports/gtfs-transit-data" target="_blank">SFMTA</a> to estimate average bus traveling speeds for a single route in San Francisco throughout the day.</p>

<p>Note:  The data for each time period analyzed is exported to CSV for client-side analysis. </p>
